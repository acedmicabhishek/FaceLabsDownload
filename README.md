**FaceLabs** is a professional facial analysis application designed to provide subjective, mathematically-driven insights into facial aesthetics. Whether you're researching facial harmony, exploring dimorphism, or analyzing bone structure, FaceLabs offers the precision and depth of professional tools right on your device.

> **Note**: FaceLabs is a closed-source application. This decision was made to prevent "looksmaxxing" course sellers and scammers from stripping the code, rebranding it, and selling it for profit. **FaceLabs is and will always be free forever.** This repository is strictly for distributing release binaries.

## Key Features

### Comprehensive Analysis Options
*   **Guided Pro Mapper**: A precise, step-by-step wizard that guides you through plotting 30+ facial landmarks for a complete aesthetic profile.
*   **Freestyle Mapper**: A flexible manual tool for quick checks or specific measurements without the full wizard flow.
*   **Dual View Support**: Analyze both **Front** and **Side** profiles for a 360-degree understanding of facial structure.
*   **Smart Detection**: Powered by TensorFlow.js (optional) for automatic landmark detection to speed up your workflow.(disabled for now)

### The 4-Pillar Scoring System
Our proprietary scoring engine evaluates faces across four distinct aesthetic pillars:
1.  **Harmony**: Checks facial balance, ratios (e.g., Facial Thirds), and symmetry.
2.  **Dimorphism**: Measures sexual dimorphism traits (Masculinity in men, Femininity in women).
3.  **Angularity**: Analyzes bone structure definition (Jawline, Cheekbones, Browridge).
4.  **Misc**: Factors in skin quality, eye area features (disabled for now)

### Real-Time Simulation Lab
*   **"What-If" Analysis**: Interactive sliders allow you to simulate changes to key metrics (like Facial Thirds or Eye Level) in real-time.
*   **Dynamic Scoring**: Watch as your Overall Score and Pillar Scores update instantly based on your adjustments, helping you understand the impact of each feature.

### Detailed Reporting
*   **Numeric Precision**: Get exact scores (0-10) for every single measurement.

### Privacy & Performance
*   **Offline-First**: All analysis happens locally on your device. Your photos are never uploaded to a server.
*   **Cross-Platform**: Fully optimized for Android touch interfaces and modern responsive web browsers.
*   **History**: Save and compare multiple analyses over time to track progress or compare different subjects.
